Pilztest game for the Minetest engine
=====================================

Installation:
-------------
Place it in the $path_user/games/ and select it in the main menu.

Goal:
-----
This game aims to have a bit more challenging gameplay than minetest_game.

There will be somwhat different "crafting trees", wich will lead to useful
tools. Currently there is only one tree going from leaves and broken stone to
iron tools. Future trees will be e.g. build on copper and lead to farming.

The "voxel idea" also plays a big role, there are only a few non blocky items.

Tips:
-----
- Sticks can be made out of 3 leaves.
- The furnace is made out of clay.
