Pilztest game for the Minetest engine
=====================================

Installation:
-------------
Place it in the $path_user/games/ and select it in the main menu.

Goal:
-----
This game aims to have a bit more challenging gameplay than minetest_game.

You start in a world where you can dig almost nothing, and have to collect
everything you can to craft it together to some tools, which lead to more
materials being available to you.
Currently you start with leaves and broken stone and will eventually end up with
powerful iron tools.

The "voxel idea" also plays a big role, there are only a few non blocky items.

Tips:
-----
- Sticks can be made out of 3 leaves.
- The furnace is made out of clay.
