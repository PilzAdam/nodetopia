Pilztest game for the Minetest engine
=====================================

Installation:
-------------
Place it in the $path_user/games/ and select it in the main menu.
Make sure that you select mapgen v7 when creating a new world.

Goal:
-----
This game aims to have a bit more challenging gameplay than minetest_game.

The "voxel idea" plays a big role, there are only a few non blocky items.

Tips:
-----
- Wood can be made out of 4 leaves, which is required to make tools.
- The furnace is made out of clay.
- Pumpkins are food, can be found in forests and grow on wet soil.
- Hungry players get slower.
